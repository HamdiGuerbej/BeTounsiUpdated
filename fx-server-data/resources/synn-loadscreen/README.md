## Known issues

[Issue 1](https://github.com/Syntasu/synn-loadscreen/issues/1)
Race condition between my loadscreen resource and the events that need to get passed to the loadscreen.
Implications are that some loadbars do not fill and upon connecting nothing happens.

[Issue 10](https://github.com/Syntasu/synn-loadscreen/issues/10)
It seems some people are affected by a bug which bugs out the loadingscreen.
